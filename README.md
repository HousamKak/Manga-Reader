## Features in Detail

### Smart Chapter Discovery

The app uses binary search to efficiently discover:
- Total number of chapters available
- Number of pages in each chapter
- Automatically generates proper URLs for all pages

### Image Caching

- Images are cached in IndexedDB for offline access
- Configurable cache size limit
- LRU (Least Recently Used) eviction policy
- Manual cache clearing option

### Progress Tracking

- Automatically saves your reading position
- Resume where you left off
- Visual progress indicators
- Per-chapter completion tracking

### PWA Capabilities

- Install as a standalone app on mobile and desktop
- Offline reading for cached chapters
- Fast loading with service worker caching
- Native app-like experience

## Browser Support

- Chrome/Edge 90+
- Firefox 88+
- Safari 14+
- Mobile browsers with modern JavaScript support

## Privacy & Security

- All data stored locally in your browser
- No external servers or tracking
- No analytics or data collection
- Content Security Policy headers
- Input validation and sanitization

## Troubleshooting

### Images not loading
- Check if the URL format is correct
- Verify you have access to the manga source
- Check browser console for CORS errors
- Try clearing the cache in settings

### Performance issues
- Reduce the number of preload pages in settings
- Lower the cache size limit
- Disable image preloading if needed
- Close other browser tabs to free up memory

### Discovery taking too long
- The binary search algorithm is efficient but may take time for large manga
- You can add manga without auto-discovery and manually navigate
- Progress is shown during discovery
